------ 2.05g ------
Spanish translation implemented by Bhasbuto. Translated by Bhasbuto, Immortality and Atoan.

------ 2.05f ------

*split the installtion in one with ToB and one without, fixing the the SoA installation (Thanks to Nicolas for the help with debugging)

------ 2.05e ------
*fixed the dialogue in the underdark with Jan even with Jan never been in the party (Thanks to Rathwellin)
*fixed Peanelian (claws and some abilities; they are now closer to the description) (Thanks to Rassadihn)
*fixed a loop in Tashia dialogue (at least I hope so) (Thanks to jcompton)
*Me (maus) is now responsible for the mod (at least for this version)

------ 2.05d ------
*new WeiDU-Version, I suppose (by someone I don't know)

------ 2.05c ------
* Bloody fix-it script better be finally totally fixed...!

------ 2.05b ------
* Fixed Tashia's stuttering problem when the protagonist was a Female past LoveTalk 23 without the happy patch installed.

------ 2.05 -------
* Darrick Yee did some (very picky!) proofreading. Additionally, two minor bugs he found were also fixed.
  NOTE: Proofread dialogs are not included in the patch.
* You can now flirt with Tashia - originally Jason Compton's idea which was viciously leeched and integrated for Tashia. :)
* Nalia banter interaction was added.

------ 2.04 -------
* Makes Tashia's ghost react to Resurrection spell/rod.
* Slightly alters Arilistan's script to make him initiate dialog
  even when the player is invisible.

------ 2.03 -------
* The final SoA LoveTalk was extended a bit, per Loin's request.

------ 2.02 -------
* Added a new picture for Tashia, drawn by Antonio Montenegro.

------ 2.01 -------
* Added Tashia's comments to player's "slayer transformation" happening during and after the Asylum plot, as well as changed the way tree-of-life and final Solar dialogs were inserted to make the mod more compatible with others.

------ 2.00 -------
* Throne of Bhaal part of the romance is now in.
* Some minor bugs fixed from the previous version.

------ 1.09c ------
* I've made some changes to the romance dialog file to make it more female protagonist-friendly.

------ 1.09b ------
* I've included all the .wav's instead of just music in a packed .mp3 format, so as a result the mod download size shrank to a mere 1.15 mb.

------ 1.09 -------
* v.1.07 and 1.08 mixed together with a new packing utility, allowing .wav's to put into .mp3's, then extracted back upon installation, thus considerably reducing the download size.

-- 1.08b/1.07d ---
* Minor fix to Tashia's self-restoration script.

------ 1.07c ------
* Fixed a minor bug in a troll-related conversation.

------ 1.07b ------
* Altered the final romance dialog to something less 'cheesy'.

------ 1.07 ------
* Fixed a rather obvious bug introduced in the previous version (thanks Barry Coley).

------ 1.06 ------
* Fixed Arilistan's dual wielding problem, and made the last step of Tashia's romance chapter-6-only, due to a difficult problem.

------ 1.05 ------
* Added Tashia's comments to slept-with-Phaere dialogs.
* If for some reason Tashia's name and sounds in your saved game got messed up (happens when you reinstall mods in a different order), just initiate dialog with Tashia and tell her that she looks odd. That should fix the problem.
